# Frontend Test Plan

This document outlines the test plan for the Kudos frontend application.

## 1. Overview

The frontend is a React application that allows users to interact with the Kudos platform. It provides functionalities for user authentication, managing kudos, and viewing company values.

## 2. Testing Strategy

The testing strategy will involve a combination of manual and automated testing to ensure the quality and stability of the frontend application.

### Manual Testing

Manual testing will be performed to cover user flows and edge cases that are difficult to automate.

### Automated Testing

Automated tests will be written using a testing framework like Jest and React Testing Library to cover individual components and their interactions.
