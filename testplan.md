# Test Plan: Kudos Platform

**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Draft

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the testing strategy for the Kudos Recognition Platform MVP. The goal is to ensure the application is functional, reliable, secure, and meets all requirements defined in the PRD and technical specification.

## 2. Scope

### In-Scope Features for Testing
- User Authentication (Login)
- Dashboard view (Balances)
- Giving Kudos (creating pending transactions)
- Global Transaction Feed (viewing approved transactions)
- Admin: User Creation
- Admin: Transaction Moderation (Approve/Deny)
- Admin: Manual Credit Allocation
- Automated monthly credit refresh

### Out-of-Scope Features
- SSO, Store integration, self-service registration, and other features listed as "Out of Scope" in the PRD.

## 3. Testing Types

- **Unit Testing:** Individual functions and components (both frontend and backend) will be tested in isolation.
- **Integration Testing:** Backend services will be tested to ensure API endpoints work as expected with the database. Frontend components will be tested to ensure they correctly call and handle API responses.
- **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:** Automated tests will simulate full user workflows from the browser, covering all major user stories (e.g., logging in, giving a kudo, admin approving it, balances updating).
- **Manual/Exploratory Testing:** Manual testing will be performed to catch issues not covered by automated tests and to verify the overall user experience.

## 4. Questions for Clarification

Before creating detailed test cases, the following points need clarification to ensure comprehensive test coverage:

1.  **Transaction Logic & Race Conditions:** The PRD states the sender's `award_balance` is debited upon admin *approval*. What is the expected behavior if a user has 100 credits, sends two separate 75-credit kudos, and an admin attempts to approve both?
    -   Should the first approval succeed and the second one fail?
    -   What specific feedback should the admin receive when the second approval fails?
    -   What feedback (if any) should the sender of the second kudo receive?

2.  **User Transaction History:** The initial exploration document mentions "Users are able to see their latest transactions." The PRD and Tech Plan focus on a global feed of *approved* transactions. Should there also be a dedicated view for a user to see their own personal transaction history (both sent and received, including `pending` and `denied` statuses)?

3.  **Notification Mechanism:** For a denied transaction, the requirement is a "simple notification." What is the specific mechanism for this? (e.g., a temporary toast/snackbar message in the UI, a permanent notification in a dedicated "Notifications" area, an email?)

4.  **User-Facing Error Handling:** Could you provide more details on the expected user-facing error messages for common failure scenarios? For example:
    -   Incorrect login credentials.
    -   Submitting the "Give Kudo" form with missing fields (e.g., no recipient).
    -   A user attempting to give more credits than they have available.
    -   A user attempting to give kudos to themselves.

5.  **Performance Testing:** The plan is to eventually support 200+ users. Should the initial test plan include any baseline performance or load testing, particularly for features like the recipient search dropdown (`GET /api/users`) which fetches all users at once?

6.  **Security Test Cases:** The tech plan covers the security foundation. Should we explicitly test for specific application-level vulnerabilities? For example:
    -   A non-admin user attempting to access admin API endpoints directly.
    -   A user attempting to approve or deny a transaction they are not a part of.
    -   Testing for potential XSS in the "shoutout/public message" field.

Once these questions are answered, a detailed list of test scenarios and cases can be developed.
