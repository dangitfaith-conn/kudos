Kudos credit system prototype (aka CUDOS rewrite)

## Goal
The main goal is to experiment with the AI workflow from the ground up.  The secondary goal is to rapidly prototype a new version of the cudos website.  There's no expectation to launch the prototype by the end of 10% week :) 

## Processs
1. We started with creating a baseline set of requirements.  Created exploration.md file describing the app we wanted to build (reward system).  Had Gemini ask follow-up questions and generated a Product Requirements Document (prd.md) and a Tech Plan (techplan.md).
2. From there, we each created our own branch (`jon-implementation` and `faith-implementation`), and went our own ways building out the MVP with Gemini.
3. We checked in with each other every day to compare notes.  We made note of how different our code structure and UI looks.  Both branches are up-to-date for anyone who wants to pull them.
