Kudos credit system prototype (aka CUDOS rewrite)

## Goal
The main goal is to experiment with the AI workflow from the ground up.  The secondary goal is to rapidly prototype a new version of the cudos website.  There's no expectation to launch this by the end of 10% week :) 

## Observations (so far)
- If you have a file opened, Gemini will read it even though you didn't explicitly tell it to do so.
- Unlike working with windsurf or cursor, AI doesn't require you to save changes before it jumps in. May need to be careful here.
- Wonderful at organizing thoughts and bouncing ideas. Saved a lot of time taking UI frameworks and breaking it down to help choose.
- Asked good questions when prompted
